# Phonebook Application

A simple menu-driven phonebook application built with Python.

## Features
- **Smart Storage:** Uses dictionaries with lists to support multiple numbers per contact.
- **Case Insensitive:** Automatically converts names to lowercase for consistent searching.
- **User-Friendly Menu:** Simple numbered interface for easy navigation.
- **Dynamic Search:** Quick contact retrieval by name.
- **Safe Exit:** Managed loop control for a smooth exit experience.

## How to Use
1. **Run the script:** Open your terminal and run `python phonebook.py`.
2. **Choose an option:** Enter a number from 1 to 6 based on the menu.
3. **Follow prompts:** Enter the name and phone number when asked.
4. **Continue or Exit:** After each action, type 'y' to return to the menu or 'n' to close the program.

## Python Concepts Used
- **Dictionaries:** To map contact names to their numbers.
- **Lists:** To store multiple phone numbers for each contact.
- **While Loops:** For creating a persistent menu and handling program flow.
- **Nested Loops:** For managing the "continue/exit" logic after each action.
- **String Methods:** Using `.strip()` and `.lower()` for input normalization.
